Introduction:

This is the capstone project of Udacity Data Scientist program. It contains data about whether customers will receive, view and use the offers that Starbucks send to them.
I did the data cleaning and find the customers than use the offers. There are three types of offers:buy one get one, discount coupon and informational offer.
Through data visualization I found that females who are older than 50 are especially proned to use the offers. Compared to males, females are more proned to use the offers.
With more data available, it is possible to use machine learning to make a model and predict who is going to use the offer based on customer infomation.

Library:

Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

File:

data: this file contains the data set, which is portfolio.json (the type of offers), profile.json (info about the customers) and transcript.json (info about offers)
